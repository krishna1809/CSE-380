/*
Chacha Chaudhary has asked Sheena to find out the Nth occurence of any Word in the Paragraph. Sheena finds it a tedious task to find Nth occurence so she wants you to write a small java program which can solve her problem and she will give you a gift for helping her. Let us write a code.

Input Format

First line reads the paragraph contents

Second line reads the word to be found and N separated by Space

Constraints

N>0 Else "Incorrect Input"

Output Format

Prints the starting index of the Nth occurence of the word in the paragraph

Prints Not Present if not occuring even a single time and prints the last occurence if occuring less than N times.

Sample Input 0

Aana bought banana.
ana 1
Sample Output 0

1
Sample Input 1

Aana bought banana
baa 3
Sample Output 1

Not Present

                if (paragraph.substring(i, i + word.length()).equals(word)) {
                    count++;
