To create an interface Resizable with methods resizeWidth(int width) and resizeHeight(int height) that allow an object to be resized. Create a class Rectangle that implements the Resizable interface and implements the resize methods. First, we define an interface "Resizable" with the methods resizeWidth(int width) and resizeHeight(int height) to allow an object to be resized. The "Rectangle" class implements the Resizable interface and provides its own implementations of the resize methods. It also has a printSize() method to display the current rectangle size. In the main() method, we create an instance of the "Rectangle" class and display its size. Then, we call the resizeWidth() and resizeHeight() methods to change the rectangle size. Finally, we print the updated size.
